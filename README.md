# xml-component

## Description
Component to convert file types. 

### Purpose
Allows users to convert attachments to JSON or XML to and from JSON
This component has 3 actions allowing users to pass in either generic but well format XML/JSON string or XML attachment 
and produces a generic string of the other file type. The output then can be maped and used in other components.

## Actions

### XML to JSON
Takes XML string and converts it to generic JSON object. The provided XML should be 
[well-formed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formed_document) in order to be parsed correctly. 
You will get an error otherwise. 

### XML Attachment to JSON
Looks at the JSON array of attachments passed in to component and converts all XML that it finds to generic JSON objects
As input, the user can enter a patter pattern for filtering files by name or leave this field empty for processing all 
incoming *.xml files.  

### JSON to XML 
Treats incoming message body as JSON and converts it to a generic XML string.

## Known limitations
 - The maximum size of incoming file for processing is 5 MiB. If the size of incoming file will be more than 5 MiB, 
 action will throw error `Attachment *.xml is to large to be processed by XML component. File limit is: 5242880 byte, 
 file given was: * byte.`. 
 - `XML Attachemnt to JSON` action does not support local agents due to current platform limitations.
